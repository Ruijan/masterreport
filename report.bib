abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces have great potential for the development of neuroprosthetic applications to assist patients suffering from brain injury or neurodegenerative disease. One type of brain-machine interface is a cortical motor prosthetic, which is used to assist paralyzed subjects. Motor prosthetics to date have typically used the motor cortex as a source of neural signals for controlling external devices. The review will focus on several new topics in the arena of cortical prosthetics. These include using: recordings from cortical areas outside motor cortex; local field potentials as a source of recorded signals; somatosensory feedback for more dexterous control of robotics; and new decoding methods that work in concert to form an ecology of decode algorithms. These new advances promise to greatly accelerate the applicability and ease of operation of motor prosthetics.},

abstract = {In this work we tackled the problem of accurate measurement of internal-external (IE) rotations in the prosthetic knee. We presented a magnetic measurement system to be implanted in the knee prostheses in order to measure IE without soft tissue artifacts. The measurement system consisted of a permanent magnet attached under the tibial plate of the prosthesis and a combination of magnetic sensors in the polyethylene insert. Two different sensor configurations were designed, and five different angle estimators for measurement of IE angles were defined and tested based on several static and dynamic measurements toward a stereophotogrammetry motion capture system. Also a noise analysis was done to see which estimators are less sensitive to measurement noise. One-sensor configuration provided lower power budget with dynamic RMS error of 0.49° and a noise range of ±0.53°. Two-sensor configuration doubles the power consumption but provided slightly lower dynamic RMS error (0.37°) and a noise range of ±0.42°, and offers the possibility of having redundancy in case of damaged sensor.},

abstract = {The concept of a brain-machine interface (BMI) or a computer-brain interface is simple: BMI creates a communication pathway for a direct control by brain of an external device. In reality BMIs are very complex devices and only recently the increase in computing power of microprocessors enabled a boom in BMI research that continues almost unabated to this date, the high point being the insertion of electrode arrays into the brains of 5 human patients in a clinical trial run by Cyberkinetics with few other clinical tests still in progress. Meanwhile several EEG-based BMI devices (non-invasive BMIs) were launched commercially. Modern electronics and dry electrode technology made possible to drive the cost of some of these devices below few hundred dollars. However, the initial excitement of the direct control by brain waves of a computer or other equipment is dampened by large efforts required for learning, high error rates and slow response speed. All these problems are directly related to low information transfer rates typical for such EEG-based BMIs. In invasive BMIs employing multiple electrodes inserted into the brain one may expect much higher information transfer rates than in EEG-based BMIs because, in theory, each electrode provides an independent information channel. However, although invasive BMIs require more expensive equipment and have ethical problems related to the need to insert electrodes in the live brain, such financial and ethical costs are often not offset by a dramatic improvement in the information transfer rate. Thus the main topic of this review is why in invasive BMIs an apparently much larger information content obtained with multiple extracellular electrodes does not translate into much higher rates of information transfer? This paper explores possible answers to this question by concluding that more research on what movement parameters are encoded by neurons in motor cortex is needed before we can enjoy the next generation BMIs.},

Specifically, this software allows predictive computations of both steady-state and dynamic optimal growth behavior, the effects of gene deletions, comprehensive robustness analyses, sampling the range of possible cellular metabolic states and the determination of network modules. Functions enabling these calculations are included in the toolbox, allowing a user to input a genome-scale metabolic model distributed in Systems Biology Markup Language format and perform these calculations with just a few lines of code. The results are predictions of cellular behavior that have been verified as accurate in a growing body of research. After software installation, calculation time is minimal, allowing the user to focus on the interpretation of the computational results.},

abstract = {Many individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) do not regain their ability to walk, even though it is a primary goal of rehabilitation. Mammals with thoracic spinal cord transection can relearn to step with their hind limbs on a treadmill when trained with sensory input associated with stepping. If humans have similar neural mechanisms for locomotion, then providing comparable training may promote locomotor recovery after SCI. We used locomotor training designed to provide sensory information associated with locomotion to improve stepping and walking in adults after SCI. Four adults with SCIs, with a mean postinjury time of 6 months, received locomotor training. Based on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale and neurological classification standards, subject 1 had a T5 injury classified as ASIA A, subject 2 had a T5 injury classified as ASIA C, subject 3 had a C6 injury classified as ASIA D, and subject 4 had a T9 injury classified as ASIA D. All subjects improved their stepping on a treadmill. One subject achieved overground walking, and 2 subjects improved their overground walking. Locomotor training using the response of the human spinal cord to sensory information related to locomotion may improve the potential recovery of walking after SCI.

abstract = {The low-frequency asynchronous switch design (LF-ASD) was introduced as a direct brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for asynchronous control applications. The LF-ASD operates as an asynchronous brain switch (ABS) which is activated only when a user intends control and maintains an inactive state output when the user is not meaning to control the device (i.e., they may be idle, thinking about a problem, or performing some other action). Results from LF-ASD evaluations have shown promise, although the reported error rates are too high for most practical applications. This paper presents the evaluation of four new LF-ASD designs with data collected from individuals with high-level spinal cord injuries and able-bodied subjects. These new designs incorporated electroencephalographic energy normalization and feature space dimensionality reduction. The error characteristics of the new ABS designs were significantly better than the LF-ASD design with true positive rate increases of approximately 33{\%} for false positive rates in the range of 1{\%}-2{\%}. The results demonstrate that the dimensionality of the LF-ASD feature space can be reduced without performance degradation. The results also confirm previous findings that spinal cord-injured subjects can operate ABS designs to the same ability as able-bodied subjects.},

abstract = {This paper briefly reviews current silent speech methodologies for normal and disabled individuals. Current techniques utilizing electromyographic (EMG) recordings of vocal tract movements are useful for physically healthy individuals but fail for tetraplegic individuals who do not have accurate voluntary control over the speech articulators. Alternative methods utilizing EMG from other body parts (e.g., hand, arm, or facial muscles) or electroencephalography (EEG) can provide capable silent communication to severely paralyzed users, though current interfaces are extremely slow relative to normal conversation rates and require constant attention to a computer screen that provides visual feedback and/or cueing. We present a novel approach to the problem of silent speech via an intracortical microelectrode brain computer interface (BCI) to predict intended speech information directly from the activity of neurons involved in speech production. The predicted speech is synthesized and acoustically fed back to the user with a delay under 50 ms. We demonstrate that the Neurotrophic Electrode used in the BCI is capable of providing useful neural recordings for over 4 years, a necessary property for BCIs that need to remain viable over the lifespan of the user. Other design considerations include neural decoding techniques based on previous research involving BCIs for computer cursor or robotic arm control via prediction of intended movement kinematics from motor cortical signals in monkeys and humans. Initial results from a study of continuous speech production with instantaneous acoustic feedback show the BCI user was able to improve his control over an artificial speech synthesizer both within and across recording sessions. The success of this initial trial validates the potential of the intracortical microelectrode-based approach for providing a speech prosthesis that can allow much more rapid communication rates.},

abstract = {We conducted a neurophysiological study of attempted speech production in a paralyzed human volunteer using chronic microelectrode recordings. The volunteer suffers from locked-in syndrome leaving him in a state of near-total paralysis, though he maintains good cognition and sensation. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of supervised classification techniques for prediction of intended phoneme production in the absence of any overt movements including speech. Such classification or decoding ability has the potential to greatly improve the quality-of-life of many people who are otherwise unable to speak by providing a direct communicative link to the general community. We examined the performance of three classifiers on a multi-class discrimination problem in which the items were 38 American English phonemes including monophthong and diphthong vowels and consonants. The three classifiers differed in performance, but averaged between 16 and 21{\%} overall accuracy (chance-level is 1/38 or 2.6{\%}). Further, the distribution of phonemes classified statistically above chance was non-uniform though 20 of 38 phonemes were classified with statistical significance for all three classifiers. These preliminary results suggest supervised classification techniques are capable of performing large scale multi-class discrimination for attempted speech production and may provide the basis for future communication prostheses.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of forward dynamic neuromusculoskeletal modeling. The aim of such models is to estimate or predict muscle forces, joint moments, and/or joint kinematics from neural signals. This is a four-step process. In the first step, muscle activation dynamics govern the transformation from the neural signal to a measure of muscle activation—a time varying parameter between 0 and 1. In the second step, muscle contraction dynamics characterize how muscle activations are transformed into muscle forces. The third step requires a model of the musculoskeletal geometry to transform muscle forces to joint moments. Finally, the equations of motion allow joint moments to be transformed into joint movements. Each step involves complex nonlinear relationships. The focus of this paper is on the details involved in the first two steps, since these are the most challenging to the biomechanician. The global process is then explained through applications to the study of predicting isometric elbow moments and dynamic knee kinetics.},

abstract = {Reaching and grasping in primates depend on the coordination of neural activity in large frontoparietal ensembles. Here we demonstrate that primates can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling a robot arm through a closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMIc) that uses multiple mathematical models to extract several motor parameters (i.e., hand position, velocity, gripping force, and the EMGs of multiple arm muscles) from the electrical activity of frontoparietal neuronal ensembles. As single neurons typically contribute to the encoding of several motor parameters, we observed that high BMIc accuracy required recording from large neuronal ensembles. Continuous BMIc operation by monkeys led to significant improvements in both model predictions and behavioral performance. Using visual feedback, monkeys succeeded in producing robot reach-and-grasp movements even when their arms did not move. Learning to operate the BMIc was paralleled by functional reorganization in multiple cortical areas, suggesting that the dynamic properties of the BMIc were incorporated into motor and sensory cortical representations.},

We examined some of the factors affecting the quality of glenoid screw fixation, including the density of the material into which the screws are placed, the purchase of individual screws, and the direction of loading in relation to screw placement. Loads were applied by the humeral component to glenoid components with different conditions of fixation. The load to failure for each set of conditions was measured and compared statistically. Load to failure was less when the glenoid component was fixed to material of lesser density. Each screw contributed to the quality of fixation; the screw nearest the point of load application made the largest contribution. Load to failure was less when the load was colinear with a line through the nonlocking holes in the base plate compared to colinear with a line through the locking holes. In performing a reverse total shoulder, surgeons should emphasize secure intraosseous placement of the fixation screws in the best quality bone available. The placement of the inferior screw appears to be the most critical.},

abstract = {We replace the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is traditionally used in in continuous speech recognition with a bi-directional recurrent neural network encoder coupled to a recurrent neural network decoder that directly emits a stream of phonemes. The alignment between the input and output sequences is established using an attention mechanism: the decoder emits each symbol based on a context created with a subset of input symbols elected by the attention mechanism. We report initial results demonstrating that this new approach achieves phoneme error rates that are comparable to the state-of-the-art HMM-based decoders, on the TIMIT dataset.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite improved results with reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), questions still remain regarding certain technical aspects of the operation. One particular area of question is the effect of subscapularis repair on complication rates, dislocation, pain, and overall range of motion. Some authors suggest that when a deltopectoral approach is used, not repairing the subscapularis leads to a higher complication rate, especially for dislocation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty database of 3 surgeons at 1 institution, we identified 55 patients who underwent RSA using the deltopectoral approach without subscapularis repair and 65 patients with subscapularis repair.

RESULTS: Complications were documented in 11 of 55 shoulders (20{\%}) without subscapularis repair and in 13 of 65 shoulders (20{\%}) with subscapularis repair. Dislocation occurred in 3 shoulders in the nonrepair group and in 2 shoulders in the repair group. These data indicate that nonrepair of the subscapularis did not have a significant effect on the risk of any complication, dislocation, infection, disassociation, or function.

CONCLUSION: Repairing the subscapularis has no appreciable effect on complication rate, dislocation events, or range of motion gains and pain relief.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Only a small percentage of auditory brainstem implant (ABI) recipients treated for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) have proved capable of identifying words using only the sound from the ABI. Recently, the ABI was applied to a series of patients with no cochlear nerve or with cochlear disorders that could not benefit from a cochlear implant (i.e., cochlear nerve aplasia or posttraumatic avulsion) or whose benefit was or would be severely compromised. A significant number of these patients have proven capable of understanding speech, including effortless telephone use. In the present study, a series of psychophysical tests were administered to determine the cause of the difference in performance between tumor (T) and nontumor (NT) ABI patients.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.

SETTING: Tertiary referral center.

PATIENTS: Twenty patients with ABIs participated in the investigation. Ten were NF2 patients and 10 NT subjects. Patient ages ranged from 24 to 61 years. Eleven were males and nine females.

INTERVENTION: Auditory rehabilitation in auditory disconnection caused by cochlea or cochlear nerve disorders.

RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between modulation detection thresholds and speech understanding and a significant difference in modulation detection between T and NT patients.

CONCLUSIONS: The difference in modulation detection between the two groups suggests a difference in the survival of specific cells in the cochlear nucleus that support modulation. The pattern of results indicates a separate pathway of auditory processing that is specialized for modulated sounds, and that pathway is critical for speech understanding. In NF2 patients, the tumor and surgery may selectively damage this pathway, resulting in poor speech recognition with prosthetic stimulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paralysis or amputation of an arm results in the loss of the ability to orient the hand and grasp, manipulate, and carry objects, functions that are essential for activities of daily living. Brain-machine interfaces could provide a solution to restoring many of these lost functions. We therefore tested whether an individual with tetraplegia could rapidly achieve neurological control of a high-performance prosthetic limb using this type of an interface.

METHODS: We implanted two 96-channel intracortical microelectrodes in the motor cortex of a 52-year-old individual with tetraplegia. Brain-machine-interface training was done for 13 weeks with the goal of controlling an anthropomorphic prosthetic limb with seven degrees of freedom (three-dimensional translation, three-dimensional orientation, one-dimensional grasping). The participant's ability to control the prosthetic limb was assessed with clinical measures of upper limb function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01364480.

FINDINGS: The participant was able to move the prosthetic limb freely in the three-dimensional workspace on the second day of training. After 13 weeks, robust seven-dimensional movements were performed routinely. Mean success rate on target-based reaching tasks was 91·6{\%} (SD 4·4) versus median chance level 6·2{\%} (95{\%} CI 2·0-15·3). Improvements were seen in completion time (decreased from a mean of 148 s [SD 60] to 112 s [6]) and path efficiency (increased from 0·30 [0·04] to 0·38 [0·02]). The participant was also able to use the prosthetic limb to do skilful and coordinated reach and grasp movements that resulted in clinically significant gains in tests of upper limb function. No adverse events were reported.

INTERPRETATION: With continued development of neuroprosthetic limbs, individuals with long-term paralysis could recover the natural and intuitive command signals for hand placement, orientation, and reaching, allowing them to perform activities of daily living.

abstract = {Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) in humans and experimental animals are often associated with varying degrees of spontaneous functional recovery during the first months after injury. Such recovery is widely attributed to axons spared from injury that descend from the brain and bypass incomplete lesions, but its mechanisms are uncertain. To investigate the neural basis of spontaneous recovery, we used kinematic, physiological and anatomical analyses to evaluate mice with various combinations of spatially and temporally separated lateral hemisections with or without the excitotoxic ablation of intrinsic spinal cord neurons. We show that propriospinal relay connections that bypass one or more injury sites are able to mediate spontaneous functional recovery and supraspinal control of stepping, even when there has been essentially total and irreversible interruption of long descending supraspinal pathways in mice. Our findings show that pronounced functional recovery can occur after severe SCI without the maintenance or regeneration of direct projections from the brain past the lesion and can be mediated by the reorganization of descending and propriospinal connections. Targeting interventions toward augmenting the remodeling of relay connections may provide new therapeutic strategies to bypass lesions and restore function after SCI and in other conditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis.},

Furthermore, monkeys combined this artificial signal with vision to form an optimal, minimum-variance estimate of relative hand position. These results demonstrate that a learning-based approach can be used to provide a rich artificial sensory feedback signal, suggesting a new strategy for restoring proprioception to patients using BMIs, as well as a powerful new tool for studying the adaptive mechanisms of sensory integration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While shoulder arthroplasty is a well established treatment for a variety of conditions about the shoulder, the results of shoulder replacement in younger patients are not as predictable. The purpose of this study is to examine the indications for shoulder arthroplasty in patients 59 years old and younger, and to analyze revision rates between younger and older patients.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of shoulder arthroplasties performed within a statewide integrated healthcare system between 2005 and 2010. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on age at time of index replacement procedure: younger patients (≤59 years) and older patients (>59 years).

RESULTS: There were 2981 primary arthroplasties followed for a median time of 2.2 years (interquartile range, 1.0-3.8), 90 (3.0{\%}) of which required revisions. After adjusting for procedure type and diagnosis, younger patients had a two times higher risk (95{\%} CI 1.2-3.5, P = .007) of revision than older patients. When looking at the risk of revision in younger and older patients separately, the risk of revision in hemiarthroplasty (RR = 4.5 vs RR = 1.7) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RR = 33.6 vs RR = 3.0) compared to total shoulder arthroplasty were higher in younger patients compared to older patients.

CONCLUSION: This study suggests patients 59 years and younger have an increased risk of revision at early follow-up. The higher risk of revision in younger patients receiving hemiarthroplasty may support the use of total shoulder arthroplasty in patients 59 years of age and younger.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a simple electromyography-force (EMG-force) model can be used to measure different levels of co-contraction about the knee for healthy subjects and patients with an anterior cruciate ligament deficiency.

DESIGN: To evaluate an EMG-to-force processing model, two groups of subjects, with and without deficiency of the anterior cruciate ligament, participated in experiments in which surface EMG, kinematics and kinetics about the knee were recorded during isokinetic and functional movements.

BACKGROUND: Clinical and biomechanical evidence supports the hypothesis that higher level of co-contraction of quadriceps and hamstrings provide an active stabilization of the knee to compensate for the lost anterior cruciate ligament. To quantify the level of co-contraction, the contribution of both agonist and antagonist muscles to the net joint moment must be known.

METHODS: Surface EMG levels were calibrated to moment by means of a limited number of isokinetic contractions about the knee. With these calibration values, an estimate of the muscle moments during a vertical jump were obtained and compared with the net joint moment, calculated with inverse dynamics. Also co-contraction indices were determined.

RESULTS: The EMG-force model provided a fair estimate of the net joint moment. The co-contraction index in anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects was significantly higher (mean 0.54 (SD, 0.04)) compared to healthy subjects (mean 0.25 (SD, 0.07)).

CONCLUSIONS: Although the EMG-to-force processing model is not perfectly accurate, it is appropriate within a clinical context.

RELEVANCE: Previous research supports the hypothesis that subjects with an anterior cruciate ligament deficiency compensate the loss of passive stability by developing higher co-activation levels of the knee muscles, i.e. active stabilization. Quantifying co-contraction may serve as a valuable parameter to evaluate clinical interventions and rehabilitation processes. The EMG-force model presented in this study appears to be a useful instrument for this purpose.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In this study, the influence of using submaximal isokinetic contractions about the knee compared to maximal voluntary contractions as input to obtain the calibration of an EMG-force model for knee muscles is investigated.

METHODS: Isokinetic knee flexion and extension contractions were performed by healthy subjects at five different velocities and at three contraction levels (100{\%}, 75{\%} and 50{\%} of MVC). Joint angle, angular velocity, joint moment and surface EMG of five knee muscles were recorded. Individual calibration values were calculated according to [C.A.M. Doorenbosch, J. Harlaar, A clinically applicable EMG-force model to quantify active stabilization of the knee after a lesion of the anterior cruciate ligament, Clinical Biomechanics 18 (2003) 142-149] for each contraction level.

RESULTS: First, the output of the model, calibrated with the 100{\%} MVC was compared to the actually exerted net knee moment at the dynamometer. Normalized root mean square errors were calculated [A.L. Hof, C.A.N. Pronk, J.A. van Best, Comparison between EMG to force processing and kinetic analysis for the calf muscle moment in walking and stepping, Journal of Biomechanics 20 (1987) 167-187] to compare the estimated moments with the actually exerted moments. Mean RMSD errors ranged from 0.06 to 0.21 for extension and from 0.12 to 0.29 for flexion at the 100{\%} trials. Subsequently, the calibration results of the 50{\%} and 75{\%} MVC calibration procedures were used. A standard signal, representing a random EMG level was used as input in the EMG force model, to compare the three models. Paired samples t-tests between the 100{\%} MVC and the 75{\%} MVC and 50{\%} MVC, respectively, showed no significant differences (p>0.05).

CONCLUSION: The application of submaximal contractions of larger than 50{\%} MVC is suitable to calibrate a simple EMG to force model for knee extension and flexion. This means that in clinical practice, the EMG to force model can be applied by patients who cannot exert maximal force.},

abstract = {Measurement of three-dimensional (3D) knee joint angle outside a laboratory is of benefit in clinical examination and therapeutic treatment comparison. Although several motion capture devices exist, there is a need for an ambulatory system that could be used in routine practice. Up-to-date, inertial measurement units (IMUs) have proven to be suitable for unconstrained measurement of knee joint differential orientation. Nevertheless, this differential orientation should be converted into three reliable and clinically interpretable angles. Thus, the aim of this study was to propose a new calibration procedure adapted for the joint coordinate system (JCS), which required only IMUs data. The repeatability of the calibration procedure, as well as the errors in the measurement of 3D knee angle during gait in comparison to a reference system were assessed on eight healthy subjects. The new procedure relying on active and passive movements reported a high repeatability of the mean values (offset<1 degrees) and angular patterns (SD<0.3 degrees and CMC>0.9). In comparison to the reference system, this functional procedure showed high precision (SD<2 degrees and CC>0.75) and moderate accuracy (between 4.0 degrees and 8.1 degrees) for the three knee angle. The combination of the inertial-based system with the functional calibration procedure proposed here resulted in a promising tool for the measurement of 3D knee joint angle. Moreover, this method could be adapted to measure other complex joint, such as ankle or elbow.},

abstract = {This study describes the stability and selectivity of four-contact spiral nerve-cuff electrodes implanted bilaterally on distal branches of the femoral nerves of a human volunteer with spinal cord injury as part of a neuroprosthesis for standing and transfers. Stimulation charge threshold, the minimum charge required to elicit a visible muscle contraction, was consistent and low (mean threshold charge at 63 weeks post-implantation: 23.3 +/- 8.5 nC) for all nerve-cuff electrode contacts over 63 weeks after implantation, indicating a stable interface with the peripheral nervous system. The ability of individual nerve-cuff electrode contacts to selectively stimulate separate components of the femoral nerve to activate individual heads of the quadriceps was assessed with fine-wire intramuscular electromyography while measuring isometric twitch knee extension moment. Six of eight electrode contacts could selectively activate one head of the quadriceps while selectively excluding others to produce maximum twitch responses of between 3.8 and 8.1 N m. The relationship between isometric twitch and tetanic knee extension moment was quantified, and selective twitch muscle responses scaled to between 15 and 35 N m in tetanic response to pulse trains with similar stimulation parameters. These results suggest that this nerve-cuff electrode can be an effective and chronically stable tool for selectively stimulating distal nerve branches in the lower extremities for neuroprosthetic applications.},

Investigated parameters were transition's duration, range of trunk tilt, smoothness of transition pattern assessed by its fractal dimension, and trunk movement's dynamic described by local wavelet energy. A measurement protocol with a Si-St followed by a St-Si postural transition was performed by two groups of participants: the first group (N=79) included Frail Elderly subjects admitted to a post-acute rehabilitation facility and the second group (N=27) were healthy community-dwelling elderly persons. Subjects were also evaluated with Tinetti's POMA scale. Compared to Healthy Elderly persons, frail group at baseline had significantly longer Si-St (3.85±1.04 vs. 2.60±0.32, p=0.001) and St-Si (4.08±1.21 vs. 2.81±0.36, p=0.001) transition's duration. Frail older persons also had significantly decreased smoothness of Si-St transition pattern (1.36±0.07 vs. 1.21±0.05, p=0.001) and dynamic of trunk movement. Measurements after three weeks of rehabilitation in frail older persons showed that smoothness of transition pattern had the highest improvement effect size (0.4) and discriminative performance. These results demonstrate the potential interest of such parameters to distinguish older subjects with different functional and health conditions.},

abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a framework for studying cortical dynamics and the neural correlates of learning. Neuroprosthetic control has been associated with tuning changes in specific neurons directly projecting to the BMI (hereafter referred to as direct neurons). However, little is known about the larger network dynamics. By monitoring ensembles of neurons that were either causally linked to BMI control or indirectly involved, we found that proficient neuroprosthetic control is associated with large-scale modifications to the cortical network in macaque monkeys. Specifically, there were changes in the preferred direction of both direct and indirect neurons. Notably, with learning, there was a relative decrease in the net modulation of indirect neural activity in comparison with direct activity. These widespread differential changes in the direct and indirect population activity were markedly stable from one day to the next and readily coexisted with the long-standing cortical network for upper limb control. Thus, the process of learning BMI control is associated with differential modification of neural populations based on their specific relation to movement control.},

However, identifying brain regions that significantly contribute to the classification/group separation requires computationally expensive permutation testing. In this paper we show that the results of SVM-permutation testing can be analytically approximated. This approximation leads to more than a thousandfold speedup of the permutation testing procedure, thereby rendering it feasible to perform such tests on standard computers. The speedup achieved makes SVM based group difference analysis competitive with standard univariate group difference analysis methods.},

@article{Georgopoulos1988,
abstract = {We measured the amount of information transmitted by the direction of two-dimensional (2-D) arm movements of human subjects, and by neuronal populations in the motor cortex and area 5 of monkeys. We also compared the information transmitted by a motor cortical population when the predictability of the direction of movement was varied, i.e. when the target of the movement was the same, or different, in successive trials. The information transmitted by a neuronal population was measured using the "population vector" code (Georgopoulos et al. 1983, 1986) as the stimulated directional output of the population. We found the following. (a) The information transmitted per movement increased in all cases with input information but more slowly than the maximum possible. No asymptote had been reached at 6.64 bits of input information; the best human performance at that level was 4.5 bits. (b) The average information transmitted by a motor cortical population (N = 253 cells) was approximately 0.5 bits higher than that of best human performance at all levels of input information. These findings indicate that whereas information loss at the level of motor cortex, and during stages preceding it, increases with increasing input information, this loss remains constant at all levels of input information during processes intervening between motor cortex and movement. (c) The information transmitted by the neuronal population at a constant level of input information increased with the number of cells in the population and had not plateaued at the population size of 253 cells used in this study. (d) Consistently higher amounts of information were transmitted by motor cortical than by area 5 populations at all levels of input information (up to 7 bits) examined. The difference was approximately 0.16 bits. (e) Finally, the information transmitted by a motor cortical population was slightly higher (by 0.07 bits) when the movement was more than less predictable. Although this difference was small, it was consistent at all levels of input information (3-7 bits) and was statistically highly significant (p less than 0.005, paired t test). These results establish the information theoretical approach as a useful method for comparing (a) behavioral and neural data, (b) neural data between different brain areas, and (c) neural data obtained under different behavioral manipulations.},

However, relatively low performance remains a critical barrier to successful clinical translation; current neural prostheses are considerably slower, with less accurate control, than the native arm. Here we present a new control algorithm, the recalibrated feedback intention-trained Kalman filter (ReFIT-KF) that incorporates assumptions about the nature of closed-loop neural prosthetic control. When tested in rhesus monkeys implanted with motor cortical electrode arrays, the ReFIT-KF algorithm outperformed existing neural prosthetic algorithms in all measured domains and halved target acquisition time. This control algorithm permits sustained, uninterrupted use for hours and generalizes to more challenging tasks without retraining. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate repeatable high performance for years after implantation in two monkeys, thereby increasing the clinical viability of neural prostheses.},

@article{Godlove2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) rely on visual feedback, requiring sustained visual attention to use the device. Improvements to BCIs may stem from the development of an effective way to provide quick feedback independent of vision. Tactile stimuli, either delivered on the skin surface, or directly to the brain via microstimulation in somatosensory cortex, could serve that purpose. We examined the effectiveness of vibrotactile stimuli and microstimulation as a means of non-visual feedback by using a fundamental element of feedback: the ability to react to a stimulus while already in motion.

APPROACH: Human and monkey subjects performed a center-out reach task which was, on occasion, interrupted with a stimulus cue that instructed a change in reach target.

MAIN RESULTS: Subjects generally responded faster to tactile cues than to visual cues. However, when we delivered cues via microstimuation in a monkey, its response was slower on average than for both tactile and visual cues.

SIGNIFICANCE: Tactile and microstimulation feedback can be used to rapidly adjust movements mid-flight. The relatively slow speed of microstimulation is surprising and warrants further investigation. Overall, these results highlight the importance of considering temporal aspects of feedback when designing alternative forms of feedback for BCIs.},

abstract = {The relationship between force and electromyographic (EMG) signals of the cat soleus muscle was obtained for three animals during locomotion at five different speeds (154 steps), using implanted EMG electrodes and a force transducer. Experimentally obtained force-IEMG (= integrated EMG) relationships were compared with theoretically predicted instantaneous activation levels calculated by dividing the measured force by the predicted maximal force that the muscle could possibly generate as a function of its instantaneous contractile conditions. In addition, muscular forces were estimated from the corresponding EMG records exclusively using an adaptive filtering approach. Mean force-IEMG relationships were highly non-linear but similar in shape for different cats and different speeds of locomotion. The theoretically predicted activation-time plots typically showed two peaks, as did the IEMG-time plots. The first IEMG peak tended to be higher than the second one and it appeared to be associated with the initial priming of the muscle for force production at paw contact and the peak force observed early during the stance phase. The second IEMG peak appeared to be a burst of high muscle activation, which might have compensated for the levels of muscle length and shortening velocity that were suboptimal during the latter part of the stance phase. Although it was difficult to explain the soleus forces on the basis of the theoretically predicted instantaneous activation levels, it was straightforward to approximate these forces accurately from EMG data using an adaptive filtering approach.},

@article{Gunther2012,
abstract = {HYPOTHESIS: The success of shoulder arthroplasty surgery has been limited by a common complication: glenoid implant loosening. Eccentric loading of the glenoid due to migration of the humeral head is considered to be the major cause of glenoid loosening and is referred to as the rocking-horse phenomenon. Glenoid implant loosening may cause pain, limitation of function, and the need for complicated revision surgery. Our hypothesis was that an inset fixation technique could offer increased fixation strength and minimize the effects of the rocking-horse phenomenon on glenoid loosening.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fixation strength and stress distribution were analyzed using two methods. First, mechanical simulation of physiologic in vivo cyclic loading was performed on 1 inset glenoid implant design and 2 standard onlay glenoid implant designs currently on the market. Second, 3-dimensional finite element analysis was performed to compare an inset glenoid implant and a standard onlay glenoid implant with a keel and a standard onlay pegged implant.

RESULTS: After cyclic loading to 100,000 cycles, no glenoid implants demonstrated signs of loosening. Mechanical testing after cyclic loading demonstrated less distraction of the glenoid rim using an inset technique compared with an onlay technique. Finite element analysis results indicated that the inset technique achieved up to an 87{\%} reduction in displacement.

CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical tests and finite element analysis support the concept of inset glenoid fixation in minimizing the risk of glenoid loosening.},

abstract = {To accurately estimate muscle forces using electromyogram (EMG) signals two fundamental steps are necessary: first, precise EMG amplitude estimation, and second a modeling scheme capable of coping with the non-linearities and dynamics of the EMG-force relationship. In this work, angle-based EMG amplitude calibration and parallel cascade identification (PCI) modeling have been combined to address the issue of EMG force estimation in dynamic contractions including concentric and eccentric contractions of the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles. The contractions were performed at a range of joint angles (15 to 105 ) and forces (0 to 30 N). Angle-based calibration has been shown to improve surface EMG (SEMG) based force estimation during isometric contractions through minimization of the effects of joint angle related factors and PCI modeling captures both the nonlinear and dynamic properties of the process being modeled. SEMG data recorded during constant force, constant velocity, and varying force, varying velocity flexion and extension trials were calibrated. The calibration values were obtained at specific elbow joint angles and then interpolated to cover the continuous range of joint angles under study. The calibrated data were then used in PCI models to estimate the force induced at the wrist. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the calibration scheme and the choice of interpolation method in improving the force estimation accuracy, and the superior performance of PCI compared to an orthogonalization method that does not explicitly model the system dynamics (p < 0:01). For the constant force, constant velocity trials, minimum {\%}RMSE of 8.3{\%} was achieved for concentric contractions with calibration; minimum {\%}RMSE values increased to 10.3{\%} for eccentric contractions and to 33.3{\%} for fully dynamic contractions. Force estimation accuracy was superior in concentric contractions in comparison to eccentric contractions (p < 0:01), which may be indicative of more nonlinearity in the eccentric SEMG-force relationship.},

abstract = {In this paper, a calibration method to compensate for changes in SEMG amplitude with joint angle is introduced. Calibration factors were derived from constant amplitude surface electromyogram (SEMG) recordings from the biceps brachii (during elbow flexion) and the triceps brachii (during elbow extension) across seven elbow joint angles. SEMG data were then recorded from the elbow flexors (biceps brachii and brachioradialis) and extensors (triceps brachii) during isometric, constant force flexion and extension contractions at the same joint angles. The resulting force at the wrist was measured. The fast orthogonal search method was used to find a mapping between the system inputs - estimated SEMG amplitudes and joint angle - and the system output - measured force, for both calibrated and non-calibrated SEMG data. Models developed with calibrated data yielded a statistically significant improvement in force estimation compared to models developed with non-calibrated data, suggesting that the calibration method can compensate for changes in the SEMG-force relationship with changing joint angle. It was also found that the number of non-linear, joint angle-dependent terms used in the SEMG-force model was reduced with calibration. Additionally, initial inter-session analysis performed for four subjects suggests that calibration values can be used for subsequent recording sessions, and different output force levels.},

abstract = {A kind of porous metal-entangled titanium wire material has been investigated in terms of the pore structure (size and distribution), the strength, the elastic modulus, and the mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile loading. Its functions and potentials for surgical application have been explained. In particular, its advantages over competitors (e.g., conventional porous titanium) have been reviewed. In the study, a group of entangled titanium wire materials with non-woven structure were fabricated by using 12-180 MPa forming pressure, which have porosity in a range of 48{\%}-82{\%}. The pores in the materials are irregular in shape, which have a nearly half-normal distribution in size range. The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus are 75 MPa, 108 MPa, and 1.05 GPa, respectively, when its porosity is 44.7{\%}. The mechanical properties decrease significantly as the porosity increases. When the porosity is 57.9{\%}, these values become 24 MPa, 47.5 MPa, and 0.33 GPa, respectively. The low elastic modulus is due to the structural flexibility of the entangled titanium wire materials. For practical reference, a group of detailed data of the porous structure and the mechanical properties are reported. This kind of material is very promising for implant applications because of their very good toughness, perfect flexibility, high strength, adequate elastic modulus, and low cost.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: No clear recommendations exist regarding optimal humeral component version and deltoid tension in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A biomechanical shoulder simulator tested humeral versions (0°, 10°, 20° retroversion) and implant thicknesses (-3, 0, +3 mm from baseline) after reverse TSA in human cadavers. Abduction and external rotation ranges of motion as well as abduction and dislocation forces were quantified for native arms and arms implanted with 9 combinations of humeral version and implant thickness.

RESULTS: Resting abduction angles increased significantly (up to 30°) after reverse TSA compared with native shoulders. With constant posterior cuff loads, native arms externally rotated 20°, whereas no external rotation occurred in implanted arms (20° net internal rotation). Humeral version did not affect rotational range of motion but did alter resting abduction. Abduction forces decreased 30{\%} vs native shoulders but did not change when version or implant thickness was altered. Humeral center of rotation was shifted 17 mm medially and 12 mm inferiorly after implantation. The force required for lateral dislocation was 60{\%} less than anterior and was not affected by implant thickness or version.

CONCLUSION: Reverse TSA reduced abduction forces compared with native shoulders and resulted in limited external rotation and abduction ranges of motion. Because abduction force was reduced for all implants, the choice of humeral version and implant thickness should focus on range of motion. Lateral dislocation forces were less than anterior forces; thus, levering and inferior/posterior impingement may be a more probable basis for dislocation (laterally) than anteriorly directed forces.},

abstract = {Sustainable microbial production of high-value organic compounds such as 3-hydroxypropanoate (3HP) is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to organic syntheses that utilize petrochemical feedstocks. We applied the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE) framework to the automated design and evaluation of novel biosynthetic routes for the production of 3HP from pyruvate. Among the pathways generated by the BNICE framework were all of the known pathways for the production of 3HP as well as numerous novel pathways. The pathways generated by BNICE were ranked based on four criteria: pathway length, thermodynamic feasibility, maximum achievable yield to 3HP from glucose, and maximum achievable activity at which 3HP can be produced. Four pathways emerged from this ranking as the most promising for the biosynthesis of 3HP, and three of these pathways, including the shortest pathways discovered, were novel. We also discovered novel routes for the biosynthesis of 28 commercially available compounds that are currently produced exclusively through organic synthesis. Examination of the optimal pathways for the biosynthesis of these 28 compounds in E. coli revealed pyruvate and succinate to be ideal intermediates for achieving high product yields from glucose.},

Despite the complementarity of these ideas, there is little crosstalk between these literatures. We propose an integrative model of the speech-related "dorsal stream" in which sensorimotor interaction primarily supports speech production, in the form of a state feedback control architecture. A critical component of this control system is forward sensory prediction, which affords a natural mechanism for limited motor influence on perception, as recent perceptual research has suggested. Evidence shows that this influence is modulatory but not necessary for speech perception. The neuroanatomy of the proposed circuit is discussed as well as some probable clinical correlates including conduction aphasia, stuttering, and aspects of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Paralysis following spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders can disconnect the brain from the body, eliminating the ability to perform volitional movements. A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.},

abstract = {Neuromotor prostheses (NMPs) aim to replace or restore lost motor functions in paralysed humans by routeing movement-related signals from the brain, around damaged parts of the nervous system, to external effectors. To translate preclinical results from intact animals to a clinically useful NMP, movement signals must persist in cortex after spinal cord injury and be engaged by movement intent when sensory inputs and limb movement are long absent. Furthermore, NMPs would require that intention-driven neuronal activity be converted into a control signal that enables useful tasks. Here we show initial results for a tetraplegic human (MN) using a pilot NMP. Neuronal ensemble activity recorded through a 96-microelectrode array implanted in primary motor cortex demonstrated that intended hand motion modulates cortical spiking patterns three years after spinal cord injury. Decoders were created, providing a 'neural cursor' with which MN opened simulated e-mail and operated devices such as a television, even while conversing. Furthermore, MN used neural control to open and close a prosthetic hand, and perform rudimentary actions with a multi-jointed robotic arm. These early results suggest that NMPs based upon intracortical neuronal ensemble spiking activity could provide a valuable new neurotechnology to restore independence for humans with paralysis.},

abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are artificial systems that aim to restore sensation and movement to paralyzed patients. So far, BMIs have enabled only one arm to be moved at a time. Control of bimanual arm movements remains a major challenge. We have developed and tested a bimanual BMI that enables rhesus monkeys to control two avatar arms simultaneously. The bimanual BMI was based on the extracellular activity of 374 to 497 neurons recorded from several frontal and parietal cortical areas of both cerebral hemispheres. Cortical activity was transformed into movements of the two arms with a decoding algorithm called a fifth-order unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The UKF was trained either during a manual task performed with two joysticks or by having the monkeys passively observe the movements of avatar arms. Most cortical neurons changed their modulation patterns when both arms were engaged simultaneously. Representing the two arms jointly in a single UKF decoder resulted in improved decoding performance compared with using separate decoders for each arm. As the animals' performance in bimanual BMI control improved over time, we observed widespread plasticity in frontal and parietal cortical areas. Neuronal representation of the avatar and reach targets was enhanced with learning, whereas pairwise correlations between neurons initially increased and then decreased. These results suggest that cortical networks may assimilate the two avatar arms through BMI control. These findings should help in the design of more sophisticated BMIs capable of enabling bimanual motor control in human patients.},

abstract = {The transcription factor Pax6, which belongs to the paired box-containing gene family, regulates developmental processes, especially in the eyes, central nervous tissues and craniofacial structures. However, the role of Pax6 in bone has never been studied exclusively. Here we report that Pax6 is expressed at both the mRNA and protein level in the calvaria and long bones of adult mice as well as osteocyte-like MLOY4 cells and suppresses the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, the expression levels of Pax6 were much higher in the calvaria than the long bones, and Pax6 was also expressed at E16 to E18 in both the calvaria and long bones. Knockdown of Pax6 in MLOY4 cells did not affect cell proliferation or survival; however, the expression of Sost, an osteocyte marker gene, was significantly decreased. In addition, the overexpression of Pax6 suppressed the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by enhancing the expression of Sost. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that Pax6 binds to the Sost promoter and that stimulation of Sost transcription by Pax6 was dependent on a specific Pax6-binding sequence within the promoter. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that Pax6 is expressed in bone and may play an important role in osteocyte differentiation by controlling canonical Wnt signaling.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that neural population responses have their own internal drive, or dynamics, that describe how the neural population evolves through time. An important prediction of neural dynamical models is that previously observed neural activity is informative of noisy yet-to-be-observed activity on single-trials, and may thus have a denoising effect. To investigate this prediction, we built and characterized dynamical models of single-trial motor cortical activity. We find these models capture salient dynamical features of the neural population and are informative of future neural activity on single trials. To assess how neural dynamics may beneficially denoise single-trial neural activity, we incorporate neural dynamics into a brain-machine interface (BMI). In online experiments, we find that a neural dynamical BMI achieves substantially higher performance than its non-dynamical counterpart. These results provide evidence that neural dynamics beneficially inform the temporal evolution of neural activity on single trials and may directly impact the performance of BMIs.},

abstract = {Myoclonus is a sudden, brief, involuntary muscle jerk. It is caused by abrupt muscle contraction, in the case of positive myoclonus, or by sudden cessation of ongoing muscular activity, in the case of negative myoclonus (NM). Myoclonus may be classified in a number of ways, although classification based on the underlying physiology is the most useful from the therapeutic viewpoint. Given the large number of possible causes of myoclonus, it is essential to take a good history, to clinically characterize myoclonus and to look for additional findings on examination in order to limit the list of possible investigations. With regards to the history, the age of onset, the character of myoclonus, precipitating or alleviating factors, family history and associated symptoms and signs are important. On examination, it is important to see whether the myoclonus appears at rest, on keeping posture or during action, to note the distribution of jerks and to look for the stimulus sensitivity. Electrophysiological tests are very helpful in determining whether myoclonus is cortical, subcortical or spinal. A single pharmacological agent rarely control myoclonus and therefore polytherapy with a combination of drugs, often in large dosages, is usually needed. Generally, antiepileptic drugs such as valproate, levetiracetam and piracetam are effective in cortical myoclonus, but less effective in other forms of myoclonus. Clonazepam may be helpful with all types of myoclonus. Focal and segmental myoclonus, irrespective of its origin, may be treated with botulinum toxin injections, with variable success.},

We use a six-step knowledge discovery process. A database consisting of 267 cleaned patient SPECT images (about 3000 2D images), accompanied by clinical information and physician interpretation was created first. Then, a new user-friendly algorithm for computerizing the diagnostic process was designed and implemented. SPECT images were processed to extract a set of features, and then explicit rules were generated, using inductive machine learning and heuristic approaches to mimic cardiologist’s diagnosis. The system is able to provide a set of computer diagnoses for cardiac SPECT studies, and can be used as a diagnostic tool by a cardiologist. The achieved results are encouraging because of the high correctness of diagnoses.},

abstract = {Mobile-bearing (MB) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was developed as an alternative to the established fixed-bearing (FB) design because of theoretical advantages. Short-term studies comparing these designs have not shown any differences in clinical and radiographic results. We compared the results at 7 years of a randomised study of patients undergoing TKA using either a FB or a MB variant of the same prosthesis. Fifty-two patients (52 knees) with an average age of 70 years received a FB posterior-stabilized prosthesis, and 50 patients (52 knees) with an average age of 72 years, a MB prosthesis. All implants were cemented and the patella was routinely resurfaced. Preoperatively, there were no differences between the two groups, and surgical procedure and postoperative protocol were the same for both. At an average follow-up of 7.1 years, no significant differences of FB over MB design could be demonstrated with respect to the American Knee Society score (AKSS), pain score, a questionnaire of general health (SF-12 score), range of motion (ROM), or complication rates. Radiographs showed no significant difference in prosthetic alignment or evidence of loosening. Two knees with a MB design required reoperation, one for persistent joint stiffness and another to treat septic loosening. One patient with a MB prosthesis with signs of tibial component loosening was asymptomatic. We conclude that at mid-term follow-up there is no evidence to prove the superiority of MB over FB TKA with regard to the clinical and radiographic results.},

abstract = {Conventionally, the practice of neurosurgery has been characterized by the removal of pathology, congenital or acquired. The emerging complement to the removal of pathology is surgery for the specific purpose of restoration of function. Advents in neuroscience, technology, and the understanding of neural circuitry are creating opportunities to intervene in disease processes in a reparative manner, thereby advancing toward the long-sought-after concept of neurorestoration. Approaching the issue of neurorestoration from a biomedical engineering perspective is the rapidly growing arena of implantable devices. Implantable devices are becoming more common in medicine and are making significant advancements to improve a patient's functional outcome. Devices such as deep brain stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators, and spinal cord stimulators are now becoming more commonplace in neurosurgery as we utilize our understanding of the nervous system to interpret neural activity and restore function. One of the most exciting prospects in neurosurgery is the technologically driven field of brain-machine interface, also known as brain-computer interface, or neuroprosthetics. The successful development of this technology will have far-reaching implications for patients suffering from a great number of diseases, including but not limited to spinal cord injury, paralysis, stroke, or loss of limb. This article provides an overview of the issues related to neurorestoration using implantable devices with a specific focus on brain-machine interface technology.},

abstract = {Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) provides therapeutic benefit for several neuropathologies including Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, chronic pain, and depression. Despite well established clinical efficacy, the mechanism(s) of DBS remains poorly understood. In this review we begin by summarizing the current understanding of the DBS mechanism. Using this knowledge as a framework, we then explore a specific hypothesis regarding DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the treatment of PD. This hypothesis states that therapeutic benefit is provided, at least in part, by activation of surviving nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, subsequent striatal dopamine release, and resumption of striatal target cell control by dopamine. While highly controversial, we present preliminary data that are consistent with specific predications testing this hypothesis. We additionally propose that developing new technologies, e.g., human electrometer and closed-loop smart devices, for monitoring dopaminergic neurotransmission during STN DBS will further advance this treatment approach.},

abstract = {Electromyographical (EMG) signals have been frequently used to estimate human muscular torques. In the field of human-assistive robotics, these methods provide valuable information to provide effectively support to the user. However, their usability is strongly limited by the necessity of complex user-dependent and session-dependent calibration procedures, which confine their use to the laboratory environment. Nonetheless, an accurate estimate of muscle torque could be unnecessary to provide effective movement assistance to users. The natural ability of human central nervous system of adapting to external disturbances could compensate for a lower accuracy of the torque provided by the robot and maintain the movement accuracy unaltered, while the effort is reduced. In order to explore this possibility, in this paper we study the reaction of ten healthy subjects to the assistance provided through a proportional EMG control applied by an elbow powered exoskeleton. This system gives only a rough estimate of the user muscular torque but does not require any specific calibration. Experimental results clearly show that subjects adapt almost instantaneously to the assistance provided by the robot and can reduce their effort while keeping full control of the movement under different dynamic conditions (i.e., no alterations of movement accuracy are observed).},

abstract = {Future neuroprosthetic devices, in particular upper limb, will require decoding and executing not only the user’s intended movement type, but also when the user intends to execute the movement. This work investigates the potential use of brain signals recorded non-invasively for detecting the time before a self-paced reaching movement is initiated which could contribute to the design of practical upper limb neuroprosthetics. In particular, we show the detection of self-paced reaching movement intention in single trials using the readiness potential, an EEG slow cortical potential computed in a narrow frequency range (0.1 to 1 Hz). Our experiments with 12 human volunteers, two of them stroke subjects, yield high detection rates prior to the movement onset and low detection rates during the non-movement intention period. With the proposed approach, movement intention was detected around 500 ms before actual onset, which clearly matches previous literature on readiness potentials. Interestingly, the result obtained with one of the stroke subjects is coherent with those achieved in healthy subjects, with single-trial performance of up to 92{\%} for the paretic arm. These results suggest that, apart from contributing to our understanding of voluntary motor control for designing more advanced neuroprostheses, our work could also have a direct impact on advancing robot-assisted neurorehabilitation.},

The root mean square (RMS) of the SEMG amplitude ($\mu$V) was calculated at different torque levels. Endurance (seconds) and median frequency (Fmed) of the SEMG power spectrum, used as parameters of fatigue, were determined at 80{\%} of MVC. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was found to be decreased in patients; the ratio between RMS values of antagonists and agonists was increased and torque–EMG ratios (Nm/$\mu$V) were decreased. These differences with respect to controls were more pronounced in MyD than in CMT. The initial Fmed value was lowest in CMT. The greatest decrease in Fmed was found in MyD. SEMG data in relation to force have not been determined before in groups of MyD or CMT patients. In both disorders, parameters differed from controls, which means that adding SEMG to strength measurements could be useful in studying the progress of the disorder and the effects of interventions.},

abstract = {EMG signals of dynamically contracting muscle have never been used to predict experimentally known muscle forces across subjects. Here, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to first derive an EMG-force relationship from a subset of experimentally determined EMGs and muscle forces; second, we use this relationship to predict individual muscle forces for different contractile conditions and in subjects whose EMG and force data were not used in the derivation of the EMG-force relationship; and third, we validate the predicted muscle forces against the known forces recorded in vivo. EMG and muscle forces were recorded from the cat soleus for a variety of locomotor conditions giving a data base from three subjects, four locomotor conditions, and 8-16 steps per subject and condition. Considering the conceptual differences in the tasks investigated (e.g. slow walking vs. trotting), the intra-subject results obtained here are superior to those published previously, even though the approach did not require a muscle model or the instantaneous contractile conditions as input for the force predictions. The inter-subject results are the first of this kind to be presented in the literature and they typically gave cross-correlation coefficients between actual and predicted forces of >0.90 and root mean square errors of <15{\%}, thus they were considered excellent. From the results of this study, it was concluded that ANNs represent a powerful tool to capture the essential features of EMG-force relationships of dynamically contracting muscle, and that ANNs might be used widely to predict muscle forces based on EMG signals.},

abstract = {During speech perception, linguistic elements such as consonants and vowels are extracted from a complex acoustic speech signal. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) participates in high-order auditory processing of speech, but how it encodes phonetic information is poorly understood. We used high-density direct cortical surface recordings in humans while they listened to natural, continuous speech to reveal the STG representation of the entire English phonetic inventory. At single electrodes, we found response selectivity to distinct phonetic features. Encoding of acoustic properties was mediated by a distributed population response. Phonetic features could be directly related to tuning for spectrotemporal acoustic cues, some of which were encoded in a nonlinear fashion or by integration of multiple cues. These findings demonstrate the acoustic-phonetic representation of speech in human STG.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure the synchrony between cortical and muscle oscillatory activities, the coherence estimate between EEG and EMG was computed.

METHODS: The multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle were recorded in 5 normal volunteers. Various types of EEG derivation methods were systematically compared to establish a standard method to study cortico-muscular coupling.

RESULTS: The use of a reference-free EEG derivation (current source density) greatly improved cortico-muscular coherence. In all subjects, EEGs over the left sensorimotor cortex were coherent with EMG (mean peak frequency: 18.7 Hz, mean highest coherence: 0.124). The time lag from cortex to muscle in 14-50 Hz was 14.3 ms. EEG source derivation revealed that both radial and tangential generators in the precentral cortex might contribute to this phenomenon. In the EEG signals using common average reference, an artifactual coherence peak over the medial frontal area was observed, which might largely be explained by volume conduction from the primary sensorimotor cortex.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the current source density or its approximation is preferable to estimate the cortico-muscular coherence and that the interpretation of such coherence using referenced EEGs should be taken with care.},

abstract = {Temperature has been extensively explored as a trigger to control the delivery of a payload from environment-sensitive polymers. The need for an external heat source only allows limited spatiotemporal control over the delivery process. We propose a new approach by using the dissipative properties of a hydrogel matrix as an internal heat source when the material is mechanically loaded. The system is comprised of a highly dissipative hydrogel matrix and thermo-sensitive nanoparticles that shrink upon an increase in temperature. Exposing the hydrogel to a cyclic mechanical loading for a period of 5 min leads to an increase of temperature of the nanoparticles. The concomitant decrease in the volume of the nanoparticles increases the permeability of the hydrogel network facilitating the release of its payload. As a proof-of-concept, we showed that the payload of the hydrogel is released after 5-8 min following the initiation of the mechanical loading. This delivery method would be particularly suited for the release of growth factor as it has been shown that cell receptor to growth factor is activated 5-20 min following a mechanical loading.},

abstract = {A potential treatment for paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury is to route control signals from the brain around the injury by artificial connections. Such signals could then control electrical stimulation of muscles, thereby restoring volitional movement to paralysed limbs. In previously separate experiments, activity of motor cortex neurons related to actual or imagined movements has been used to control computer cursors and robotic arms, and paralysed muscles have been activated by functional electrical stimulation. Here we show that Macaca nemestrina monkeys can directly control stimulation of muscles using the activity of neurons in the motor cortex, thereby restoring goal-directed movements to a transiently paralysed arm. Moreover, neurons could control functional stimulation equally well regardless of any previous association to movement, a finding that considerably expands the source of control signals for brain-machine interfaces. Monkeys learned to use these artificial connections from cortical cells to muscles to generate bidirectional wrist torques, and controlled multiple neuron-muscle pairs simultaneously. Such direct transforms from cortical activity to muscle stimulation could be implemented by autonomous electronic circuitry, creating a relatively natural neuroprosthesis. These results are the first demonstration that direct artificial connections between cortical cells and muscles can compensate for interrupted physiological pathways and restore volitional control of movement to paralysed limbs.},

The time of sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions and their duration were measured using a miniature gyroscope attached to the chest and a portable recorder placed on the waist. Based on a simple model and the discrete wavelet transform, three parameters related to the PT were measured, namely, the average and standard deviation of transition duration and the occurrence of abnormal successive transitions (number of attempts to have a successful transition). The comparison between two groups of elderly subjects (with high and low fall-risk) showed that the computed parameters were significantly correlated with the falling risk as determined by the record of falls during the previous year, balance and gait disorders (Tinetti score), visual disorders, and cognitive and depressive disorders (p < 0.01). In this study, the wavelet transform has provided a powerful technique for enhancing the pattern of PT, which was mainly concentrated into the frequency range of 0.04-0.68 Hz. The system is especially adapted for long-term ambulatory monitoring of elderly people.},

abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) establish direct communication between the brain and artificial actuators. As such, they hold considerable promise for restoring mobility and communication in patients suffering from severe body paralysis. To achieve this end, future BMIs must also provide a means for delivering sensory signals from the actuators back to the brain. Prosthetic sensation is needed so that neuroprostheses can be better perceived and controlled. Here we show that a direct intracortical input can be added to a BMI to instruct rhesus monkeys in choosing the direction of reaching movements generated by the BMI. Somatosensory instructions were provided to two monkeys operating the BMI using either: (a) vibrotactile stimulation of the monkey's hands or (b) multi-channel intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) delivered to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in one monkey and posterior parietal cortex (PP) in the other. Stimulus delivery was contingent on the position of the computer cursor: the monkey placed it in the center of the screen to receive machine-brain recursive input. After 2 weeks of training, the same level of proficiency in utilizing somatosensory information was achieved with ICMS of S1 as with the stimulus delivered to the hand skin. ICMS of PP was not effective. These results indicate that direct, bi-directional communication between the brain and neuroprosthetic devices can be achieved through the combination of chronic multi-electrode recording and microstimulation of S1. We propose that in the future, bidirectional BMIs incorporating ICMS may become an effective paradigm for sensorizing neuroprosthetic devices.},

abstract = {Humans need communication. The desire to communicate remains one of the primary issues for people with locked-in syndrome (LIS). While many assistive and augmentative communication systems that use various physiological signals are available commercially, the need is not satisfactorily met. Brain interfaces, in particular, those that utilize event related potentials (ERP) in electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the intent of a person noninvasively, are emerging as a promising communication interface to meet this need where existing options are insufficient. Existing brain interfaces for typing use many repetitions of the visual stimuli in order to increase accuracy at the cost of speed. However, speed is also crucial and is an integral portion of peer-to-peer communication; a message that is not delivered timely often looses its importance. Consequently, we utilize rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) in conjunction with language models in order to assist letter selection during the brain-typing process with the final goal of developing a system that achieves high accuracy and speed simultaneously. This paper presents initial results from the RSVP Keyboard system that is under development. These initial results on healthy and locked-in subjects show that single-trial or few-trial accurate letter selection may be possible with the RSVP Keyboard paradigm.},

Understanding the different neural circuits underlying diverse language functions is a key to developing more effective treatment strategies. This chapter discusses a systems identification analytic approach to the study of linguistic neural representation. The focus of this framework is a quantitative, model-based characterization of speech and language neural representations that can be used to decode, or predict, speech representations from measured brain activity.

There is a noticeably elevated level of mutation in the paired domain compared with the rest of the gene. Increased mutation in the homeodomain is accounted for by the hypermutable CpG dinucleotide in codon 240.

abstract = {The sensorimotor system's beauty becomes evident when the system is put to the test.  In order to understand the neural and physiological mechanisms of motor control, researchers need tasks where the task difficulty can be adjusted.  By studying the interplay between difficulty and the motor parameter of interest, we can begin to tease apart the inner-workings of how the sensorimotor system is able to act in the face of sensorimotor delay, perform macro- and micro-scale movements, and learn to perform new tasks. 

We tested the ability of human and monkey subjects to perform a new task, called the Critical Stability Task.  In this task, we can pressure the sensorimotor loop to act as quickly as possible, in order to look for deficiencies in the motor or sensory components of control.  Additionally, the difficulty of this task is decided by a single number, which enables the subject's sensorimotor performance to be evaluated by a single number.  This task will be valuable for testing and evaluating new forms of sensory substitution, new non-visual feedback methods for brain-computer interface control, as well as serve as a tool for neurological assessment.  

While using this task in monkey subjects, it became apparent how little we know about the control of very small movements.  In the Critical Stability Task, the majority of the movements are under +/-10mm, and only exceed this window once control becomes difficult.  As such, we began an investigation of the neural representation of small amplitude movements.

Finally, we tested the neural constraints of learning a new task.  We setup two different types of perturbed brain-computer interface (BCI) decoders.  The first type maintained the prior patterns of neural activity, the second type required the monkey to generate new patterns of neural activity.  We found that within a day, it was difficult for monkey subjects to learn to generate new patterns of neural activity.  Taken together, task difficulty is a powerful tool for assessing sensorimotor performance.  The only way to improve poor motor performance, be it natural control or BCI control, is to detect poor motor performance with the right assessment tool.},

abstract = {Brain computer interface (BCI) control predominately uses visual feedback. Real arm movements, however, are controlled under a diversity of feedback mechanisms. The lack of additional BCI feedback modalities forces users to maintain visual contact while performing tasks. Such stringent requirements result in poor BCI control during tasks that inherently lack visual feedback, such as grasping, or when visual attention is diverted. Using a modified version of the Critical Tracking Task which we call the Critical Stability Task (CST), we tested the ability of 9 human subjects to control an unstable system using either free arm movements or pinch force. The subjects were provided either visual feedback, 'proportional' vibrotactile feedback, or 'on-off' vibrotactile feedback about the state of the unstable system. We increased the difficulty of the control task by making the virtual system more unstable. We judged the effectiveness of a particular form of feedback as the maximal instability the system could reach before the subject lost control of it. We found three main results. First, subjects can use solely vibrotactile feedback to control an unstable system, although control was better using visual feedback. Second, 'proportional' vibrotactile feedback provided slightly better control than 'on-off' vibrotactile feedback. Third, there was large intra-subject variability in terms of the most effective input and feedback methods. This highlights the need to tailor the input and feedback methods to the subject when a high degree of control is desired. Our new task can provide a complement to traditional center-out paradigms to help boost the real-world relevance of BCI research in the lab.},

abstract = {In paraplegic patients with upper motor neuron lesions the signal path from the central nervous system to the muscles is interrupted. Functional electrical stimulation applied to the lower motor neurons can replace the lacking signals. A so-called neuroprosthesis may be used to restore motor function in paraplegic patients on the basis of functional electrical stimulation. However, the control of multiple joints is difficult due to the complexity, nonlinearity, and time-variance of the system involved. Furthermore, effects such as muscle fatigue, spasticity, and limited force in the stimulated muscle further complicate the control task. Mathematical models of the human musculoskeletal system can support the development of neuroprosthesis. In this article a detailed overview of the existing work in the literature is given and two examples developed by the author are presented that give an insight into model-based development of neuroprosthesis for paraplegic patients. It is shown that modelling the musculoskeletal system can provide better understanding of muscular force production and movement coordination principles. Models can also be used to design and test stimulation patterns and feedback control strategies. Additionally, model components can be implemented in a controller to improve control performance. Eventually, the use of musculoskeletal models for neuroprosthesis design may help to avoid internal disturbances such as fatigue and optimize muscular force output. Furthermore, better controller quality can be obtained than in previous empirical approaches. In addition, the number of experimental tests to be performed with human subjects can be reduced. It is concluded that mathematical models play an increasing role in the development of reliable closed-loop controlled, lower extremity neuroprostheses.},

abstract = {Soft tissue artifact is known to be one of the main sources of errors in motion analysis by means of stereophotogrammetry. Among many approaches to reduce such errors, one is to estimate the position of anatomical landmarks during a motion with joint angle or displacement of skin markers, which is the so-called compensation method of anatomical landmarks. The position of anatomical landmarks was modeled from the data of the so-called dynamic calibration, in which anatomical landmark positions are calibrated in an ad hoc motion. This study aimed to apply the compensation methods with joint angle and skin marker displacement to three lower extremity motions (walking, sit-to-stand/stand-to-sit, and step up/down) in ten healthy males and compare their reliability. To compare the methods, two sets of kinematic variables were calculated using two different marker clusters, and the difference was obtained. Results showed that the compensation method with skin marker displacement had less differences by 30-60{\%} compared to without compensation. In addition, it had significantly less difference in some kinematic variables (7 of 18) by 25-40{\%} compared to the compensation method with joint angle.},

abstract = {A new ambulatory method of monitoring physical activities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is proposed based on a portable data-logger with three body-fixed inertial sensors. A group of ten PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and ten normal control subjects followed a protocol of typical daily activities and the whole period of the measurement was recorded by video. Walking periods were recognized using two sensors on shanks and lying periods were detected using a sensor on trunk. By calculating kinematics features of the trunk movements during the transitions between sitting and standing postures and using a statistical classifier, sit-to-stand (SiSt) and stand-to-sit (StSi) transitions were detected and separated from other body movements. Finally, a fuzzy classifier used this information to detect periods of sitting and standing. The proposed method showed a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of basic body postures allocations: sitting, standing, lying, and walking periods, both in PD patients and healthy subjects. We found significant differences in parameters related to SiSt and StSi transitions between PD patients and controls and also between PD patients with and without STN-DBS turned on. We concluded that our method provides a simple, accurate, and effective means to objectively quantify physical activities in both normal and PD patients and may prove useful to assess the level of motor functions in the latter.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that monkeys and humans can use signals from the brain to guide computer cursors. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or approximately 15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.},

abstract = {This work examined if currently available electromyography (EMG) driven models, that are calibrated to satisfy joint moments about one single degree of freedom (DOF), could provide the same musculotendon unit (MTU) force solution, when driven by the same input data, but calibrated about a different DOF. We then developed a novel and comprehensive EMG-driven model of the human lower extremity that used EMG signals from 16 muscle groups to drive 34 MTUs and satisfy the resulting joint moments simultaneously produced about four DOFs during different motor tasks. This also led to the development of a calibration procedure that allowed identifying a set of subject-specific parameters that ensured physiological behavior for the 34 MTUs. Results showed that currently available single-DOF models did not provide the same unique MTU force solution for the same input data. On the other hand, the MTU force solution predicted by our proposed multi-DOF model satisfied joint moments about multiple DOFs without loss of accuracy compared to single-DOF models corresponding to each of the four DOFs. The predicted MTU force solution was (1) a function of experimentally measured EMGs, (2) the result of physiological MTU excitation, (3) reflected different MTU contraction strategies associated to different motor tasks, (4) coordinated a greater number of MTUs with respect to currently available single-DOF models, and (5) was not specific to an individual DOF dynamics. Therefore, our proposed methodology has the potential of producing a more dynamically consistent and generalizable MTU force solution than was possible using single-DOF EMG-driven models. This will help better address the important scientific questions previously approached using single-DOF EMG-driven modeling. Furthermore, it might have applications in the development of human-machine interfaces for assistive devices.},

@article{Scheidt2005,
abstract = {People tend to make straight and smooth hand movements when reaching for an object. These trajectory features are resistant to perturbation, and both proprioceptive as well as visual feedback may guide the adaptive updating of motor commands enforcing this regularity. How is information from the two senses combined to generate a coherent internal representation of how the arm moves? Here we show that eliminating visual feedback of hand-path deviations from the straight-line reach (constraining visual feedback of motion within a virtual, "visual channel") prevents compensation of initial direction errors induced by perturbations. Because adaptive reduction in direction errors occurred with proprioception alone, proprioceptive and visual information are not combined in this reaching task using a fixed, linear weighting scheme as reported for static tasks not requiring arm motion. A computer model can explain these findings, assuming that proprioceptive estimates of initial limb posture are used to select motor commands for a desired reach and visual feedback of hand-path errors brings proprioceptive estimates into registration with a visuocentric representation of limb position relative to its target. Simulations demonstrate that initial configuration estimation errors lead to movement direction errors as observed experimentally. Registration improves movement accuracy when veridical visual feedback is provided but is not invoked when hand-path errors are eliminated. However, the visual channel did not exclude adjustment of terminal movement features maximizing hand-path smoothness. Thus visual and proprioceptive feedback may be combined in fundamentally different ways during trajectory control and final position regulation of reaching movements.},

abstract = {For the severely handicapped patient, such as a quadriplegic, a large number of independent signals would be desirable to control neuromuscular stimulators that could impart movement to the paralyzed limbs. We have investigated the possibility of making long-term connections to the central nervous system with microelectrodes. Monkeys have been implanted with arrays of intracortical electrodes for periods of up to 37 months, indicating that long-term connections to the nervous system are possible. A second question investigated was whether the implanted monkeys could learn to modify the firing patterns of recorded neurons to control a device outside of their bodies. Through the use of an 8 target tracking task a monkey was able to produce an information transfer rate of 2.45 bits/sec when cortical cell signals were the monkey's output. The same task was performed having the monkey move a handle by wrist flexion and extension (i.e., using the intact motor system as the output). The information transfer rate increased to 4.48 bits/sec, or less than a twofold improvement. Thus, the direct output of cortical cells can provide information transfer only moderately less precise than the intact motor system. Our preliminary studies have been encouraging on obtaining connections to the nervous system to control external devices. However, numerous improvements are required in electrode design, fabrication, implantation, and signal processing techniques before this method of obtaining control signals would be feasible for human applications.},

abstract = {Chronic recording microelectrodes were implanted in the hand-arm area of the precentral gyrus of three Macca mulatta monkeys. The firing patterns of individual and combined units were operantly conditioned with either a four- or an eight-target random tracking task. Neurons were considered “conditioned” only if the performance was significantly different from control runs. Conditioning occurred in 77{\%} (37 of 48) of the single units and 65{\%} (15 of 23) of the combined units. The activity of conditioned neurons was associated with specific hand or limb movements, whereas the activity of unconditioned neurons was either uncorrelated with any movement made by the monkey or correlated with seldom-made movements. Performance was measured in terms of information outflow rate to compare different task parameters. The best performance of 3.85 bits/s was obtained with a four-target, 0.5 s hold-time task. This compared to 4.29 bits/s when the same task was performed with a manipulandum and wrist movement. Monkeys were able to exert fine control of the firing rate of cortical neurons and to change rapidly from one rate to another on visual command.},

abstract = {The development of cochlear implantation has allowed the majority of patients deafened after the development of language to regain significant auditory benefit. In a subset of patients, however, loss of hearing results from destruction of the cochlear nerves, rendering cochlear implantation ineffective. The most common cause of bilateral destruction of the cochlear nerves is neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The hallmark of this genetic disorder is the development of bilateral acoustic neuromas, the growth or removal of which causes deafness in most patients. Patients with NF2 may benefit from direct stimulation of the cochlear nucleus. We describe the development, use, and results of the auditory brainstem implant (ABI), which is typically implanted via craniotomy at the time of tumor removal. Most patients with the implant have good appreciation of environmental sounds, but obtain more modest benefit with regard to speech perception. The majority of patients make use of the implant to facilitate lip reading; some can, to varying degrees, comprehend speech directly. We discuss future directions in central implants for hearing, including the penetrating ABI, the use of ABI in nontumor patients, and the auditory midbrain implant.},

abstract = {During development, tissue-specific transcription factors regulate both protein-coding and non-coding genes to control differentiation. Recent studies have established a dual role for the transcription factor Pax6 as both an activator and repressor of gene expression in the eye, central nervous system, and pancreas. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory activity of Pax6 is not fully understood. Here, we reveal that Trpm3 and the intronic microRNA gene miR-204 are co-regulated by Pax6 during eye development. miR-204 is probably the best known microRNA to function as a negative modulator of gene expression during eye development in vertebrates. Analysis of genes altered in mouse Pax6 mutants during lens development revealed significant over-representation of miR-204 targets among the genes up-regulated in the Pax6 mutant lens. A number of new targets of miR-204 were revealed, among them Sox11, a member of the SoxC family of pro-neuronal transcription factors, and an important regulator of eye development. Expression of Trpm/miR-204 and a few of its targets are also Pax6-dependent in medaka fish eyes. Collectively, this study identifies a novel evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which Pax6 controls the down-regulation of multiple genes through direct up-regulation of miR-204.},

Pax6 is required for initiation of developmental pathways, patterning of epithelial tissues, activation of tissue-specific genes and interaction with other regulatory pathways.

Specifically, we describe the regulation of Pax6's expression pattern, the protein's DNA-binding properties, and its specific roles and mechanisms of action at all stages of lens and retinal development.

abstract = {The House Ear Institute (HEI) had a long and distinguished history of auditory implant innovation and development. Early clinical innovations include being one of the first cochlear implant (CI) centers, being the first center to implant a child with a cochlear implant in the US, developing the auditory brainstem implant, and developing multiple surgical approaches and tools for Otology. This paper reviews the second stage of auditory implant research at House - in-depth basic research on perceptual capabilities and signal processing for both cochlear implants and auditory brainstem implants. Psychophysical studies characterized the loudness and temporal perceptual properties of electrical stimulation as a function of electrical parameters. Speech studies with the noise-band vocoder showed that only four bands of tonotopically arrayed information were sufficient for speech recognition, and that most implant users were receiving the equivalent of 8-10 bands of information. The noise-band vocoder allowed us to evaluate the effects of the manipulation of the number of bands, the alignment of the bands with the original tonotopic map, and distortions in the tonotopic mapping, including holes in the neural representation. Stimulation pulse rate was shown to have only a small effect on speech recognition. Electric fields were manipulated in position and sharpness, showing the potential benefit of improved tonotopic selectivity. Auditory training shows great promise for improving speech recognition for all patients. And the Auditory Brainstem Implant was developed and improved and its application expanded to new populations. Overall, the last 25 years of research at HEI helped increase the basic scientific understanding of electrical stimulation of hearing and contributed to the improved outcomes for patients with the CI and ABI devices. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Lasker Award>.},

abstract = {Individuals following stroke exhibit altered muscle activation and movement patterns. Improving the efficiency of gait can be facilitated by knowing which muscles are affected and how they contribute to the pathological pattern. In this paper we present an electromyographically (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model to estimate muscle forces and joint moments. Subject specific EMG for the primary ankle plantar and dorsiflexor muscles, and joint kinematics during walking for four subjects following stroke were used as inputs to the model to predict ankle joint moments during stance. The model's ability to predict the joint moment was evaluated by comparing the model output with the moment computed using inverse dynamics. The model did predict the ankle moment with acceptable accuracy, exhibiting an average R(2) value ranging between 0.87 and 0.92, with RMS errors between 9.7{\%} and 14.7{\%}. The values are in line with previous results for healthy subjects, suggesting that EMG-driven modeling in this population of patients is feasible. It is our hope that such models can provide clinical insight into developing more effective rehabilitation therapies and to assess the effects of an intervention.},

Over the past three years, massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of DNA sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design. Next-generation DNA sequencing has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.},

abstract = {To further understand how tactile information is carried in somatosensory cortex (S1) and the thalamus (VPL), and how neuronal plasticity after neuroprosthetic stimulation affects sensory encoding, we chronically implanted microelectrode arrays across hand areas in both S1 and VPL, where neuronal activities were simultaneously recorded during tactile stimulation on the finger pad of awake monkeys. Tactile information encoded in the firing rate of individual units (rate coding) or in the synchrony of unit pairs (synchrony coding) was quantitatively assessed within the information theoretic-framework. We found that tactile information encoded in VPL was higher than that encoded in S1 for both rate coding and synchrony coding; rate coding carried greater information than synchrony coding for the same recording area. With the aim for neuroprosthetic stimulation, plasticity of the circuit was tested after 30min of VPL electrical stimulation, where stimuli were delivered either randomly or contingent on the spiking of an S1 unit. We showed that neural encoding in VPL was more stable than in S1, which depends not only on the thalamic input but also on recurrent feedback. The percent change of mutual-information after stimulation was increased with closed-loop stimulation, but decreased with random stimulation. The underlying mechanisms during closed-loop stimulation might be spike-timing-dependent plasticity, while frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity might play a role in random stimulation. Our results suggest that VPL could be a promising target region for somatosensory stimulation with closed-loop brain-machine-interface applications.},

Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts.},

In medial-frontal neurons, we observe highly specific tuning to individual vowels, whereas superior temporal gyrus neurons have nonspecific, sinusoidally modulated tuning (analogous to motor cortical directional tuning). At the neuronal population level, a decoding analysis reveals that the underlying structure of vowel encoding reflects the anatomical basis of articulatory movements. This structured encoding enables accurate decoding of volitional speech segments and could be applied in the development of brain-machine interfaces for restoring speech in paralysed individuals.},

In this study, subjects had real-time visual feedback of their brain-controlled trajectories. Cell tuning properties changed when used for brain-controlled movements. By using control algorithms that track these changes, subjects made long sequences of 3D movements using far fewer cortical units than expected. Daily practice improved movement accuracy and the directional tuning of these units.},

abstract = {Interaction with machines is mediated by human-machine interfaces (HMIs). Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are a particular class of HMIs and have so far been studied as a communication means for people who have little or no voluntary control of muscle activity. In this context, low-performing interfaces can be considered as prosthetic applications. On the other hand, for able-bodied users, a BMI would only be practical if conceived as an augmenting interface. In this paper, a method is introduced for pointing out effective combinations of interfaces and devices for creating real-world applications. First, devices for domotics, rehabilitation and assistive robotics, and their requirements, in terms of throughput and latency, are described. Second, HMIs are classified and their performance described, still in terms of throughput and latency. Then device requirements are matched with performance of available interfaces. Simple rehabilitation and domotics devices can be easily controlled by means of BMI technology. Prosthetic hands and wheelchairs are suitable applications but do not attain optimal interactivity. Regarding humanoid robotics, the head and the trunk can be controlled by means of BMIs, while other parts require too much throughput. Robotic arms, which have been controlled by means of cortical invasive interfaces in animal studies, could be the next frontier for non-invasive BMIs. Combining smart controllers with BMIs could improve interactivity and boost BMI applications.},

Here, we introduce an electrochemical neuroprosthesis and a robotic postural interface designed to encourage supraspinally mediated movements in rats with paralyzing lesions.

This recovery relied on the extensive remodeling of cortical projections, including the formation of brainstem and intraspinal relays that restored qualitative control over electrochemically enabled lumbosacral circuitries. Automated treadmill-restricted training, which did not engage cortical neurons, failed to promote translesional plasticity and recovery. By encouraging active participation under functional states, our training paradigm triggered a cortex-dependent recovery that may improve function after similar injuries in humans.},

abstract = {Arm movement is well represented in populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex. Cortical activity patterns have been used in the new field of brain-machine interfaces to show how cursors on computer displays can be moved in two- and three-dimensional space. Although the ability to move a cursor can be useful in its own right, this technology could be applied to restore arm and hand function for amputees and paralysed persons. However, the use of cortical signals to control a multi-jointed prosthetic device for direct real-time interaction with the physical environment ('embodiment') has not been demonstrated. Here we describe a system that permits embodied prosthetic control; we show how monkeys (Macaca mulatta) use their motor cortical activity to control a mechanized arm replica in a self-feeding task. In addition to the three dimensions of movement, the subjects' cortical signals also proportionally controlled a gripper on the end of the arm. Owing to the physical interaction between the monkey, the robotic arm and objects in the workspace, this new task presented a higher level of difficulty than previous virtual (cursor-control) experiments. Apart from an example of simple one-dimensional control, previous experiments have lacked physical interaction even in cases where a robotic arm or hand was included in the control loop, because the subjects did not use it to interact with physical objects-an interaction that cannot be fully simulated. This demonstration of multi-degree-of-freedom embodied prosthetic control paves the way towards the development of dexterous prosthetic devices that could ultimately achieve arm and hand function at a near-natural level.},

abstract = {Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU score improvements on Flickr30k, from 55 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 27.},

abstract = {Arrays of electrodes for recording and stimulating the brain are used throughout clinical medicine and basic neuroscience research, yet are unable to sample large areas of the brain while maintaining high spatial resolution because of the need to individually wire each passive sensor at the electrode-tissue interface. To overcome this constraint, we developed new devices that integrate ultrathin and flexible silicon nanomembrane transistors into the electrode array, enabling new dense arrays of thousands of amplified and multiplexed sensors that are connected using fewer wires. We used this system to record spatial properties of cat brain activity in vivo, including sleep spindles, single-trial visual evoked responses and electrographic seizures. We found that seizures may manifest as recurrent spiral waves that propagate in the neocortex. The developments reported here herald a new generation of diagnostic and therapeutic brain-machine interface devices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reverse total shoulder arthroplasty was introduced to treat the rotator cuff-deficient shoulder. Since its introduction, an improved understanding of the biomechanics of rotator cuff deficiency and reverse shoulder arthroplasty has facilitated the development of modern reverse arthroplasty designs.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We review (1) the basic biomechanical challenges associated with the rotator cuff-deficient shoulder; (2) the biomechanical rationale for newer reverse shoulder arthroplasty designs; (3) the current scientific evidence related to the function and performance of reverse shoulder arthroplasty; and (4) specific technical aspects of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

METHODS: A PubMed search of the English language literature was conducted using the key words reverse shoulder arthroplasty, rotator cuff arthropathy, and biomechanics of reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Articles were excluded if the content fell outside of the biomechanics of these topics, leaving the 66 articles included in this review.

RESULTS: Various implant design factors as well as various surgical implantation techniques affect stability of reverse shoulder arthroplasty and patient function. To understand the implications of individual design factors, one must understand the function of the normal and the cuff-deficient shoulder and coalesce this understanding with the pathology presented by each patient to choose the proper surgical technique for reconstruction.

CONCLUSIONS: Several basic science and clinical studies improve our understanding of various design factors in reverse shoulder arthroplasty. However, much work remains to further elucidate the performance of newer designs and to evaluate patient outcomes using validated instruments such as the American Society for Elbow Surgery, simple shoulder test, and the Constant-Murley scores.},

abstract = {Signals derived from the rat motor cortex can be used for controlling one-dimensional movements of a robot arm. It remains unknown, however, whether real-time processing of cortical signals can be employed to reproduce, in a robotic device, the kind of complex arm movements used by primates to reach objects in space. Here we recorded the simultaneous activity of large populations of neurons, distributed in the premotor, primary motor and posterior parietal cortical areas, as non-human primates performed two distinct motor tasks. Accurate real-time predictions of one- and three-dimensional arm movement trajectories were obtained by applying both linear and nonlinear algorithms to cortical neuronal ensemble activity recorded from each animal. In addition, cortically derived signals were successfully used for real-time control of robotic devices, both locally and through the Internet. These results suggest that long-term control of complex prosthetic robot arm movements can be achieved by simple real-time transformations of neuronal population signals derived from multiple cortical areas in primates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aims to clarify the effect of various designs of reverse shoulder prosthesis (RSP) on stress variation of its glenoid component using 2-dimensional (2D) finite element analysis (FEA). This FEA study provides future reference for the optimal design of glenoid component of RSP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a 2D finite element (FE) model of human shoulder with implementation of RSP was developed by commercial FE software. The proper material properties were adopted in our model. Various design factors were simulated and all the mechanical profile data were investigated by FEA.

RESULTS: Both distal placement and increased lateral offset of glenosphere induce higher stress over glenoid-baseplate junction. Increased thickness of graft, inferiorly tilting of the baseplate, and adoption of BIO-RSA (bony increased-offset reverse shoulder arthroplasty) incur higher stresses over glenoid screws. The inferior screw attains more stress than superior screw. Maximum stress occurs at the base of inferior screw.

CONCLUSION: Increased eccentric offset and lateral offset of glenosphere, although being able to reduce notching, may pay the penalty of significant stress concentration over glenoid and its subsequent loosening. Maximum stress occurs at the base of inferior screw elucidate the direct contact failure mode at the middle of inferior screw. This study provides an alternative tool for the optimal design of glenoid component of RSP in the future.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the current prevalence of limb loss in the United States and project the future prevalence to the year 2050.

DESIGN: Estimates were constructed using age-, sex-, and race-specific incidence rates for amputation combined with age-, sex-, and race-specific assumptions about mortality. Incidence rates were derived from the 1988 to 1999 Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, corrected for the likelihood of reamputation among those undergoing amputation for vascular disease. Incidence rates were assumed to remain constant over time and applied to historic mortality and population data along with the best available estimates of relative risk, future mortality, and future population projections. To investigate the sensitivity of our projections to increasing or decreasing incidence, we developed alternative sets of estimates of limb loss related to dysvascular conditions based on assumptions of a 10{\%} or 25{\%} increase or decrease in incidence of amputations for these conditions.

SETTING: Community, nonfederal, short-term hospitals in the United States.

PARTICIPANTS: Persons who were discharged from a hospital with a procedure code for upper-limb or lower-limb amputation or diagnosis code of traumatic amputation.

INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of limb loss by age, sex, race, etiology, and level in 2005 and projections to the year 2050.

RESULTS: In the year 2005, 1.6 million persons were living with the loss of a limb. Of these subjects, 42{\%} were nonwhite and 38{\%} had an amputation secondary to dysvascular disease with a comorbid diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. It is projected that the number of people living with the loss of a limb will more than double by the year 2050 to 3.6 million. If incidence rates secondary to dysvascular disease can be reduced by 10{\%}, this number would be lowered by 225,000.

CONCLUSIONS: One in 190 Americans is currently living with the loss of a limb. Unchecked, this number may double by the year 2050.},
